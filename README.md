# Fluxion 🚀

A high-performance inference engine for Flux Models, designed as a faster alternative to Diffusers and ComfyUI.

## Overview

Fluxion is a cutting-edge inference optimization framework that accelerates Flux model inference while maintaining high-quality outputs. Built with performance in mind, it offers significant speedups compared to traditional inference pipelines like Diffusers and ComfyUI.

## Key Features

- ⚡ **Ultra-Fast Inference**: Optimized pipeline for maximum throughput
- 🎯 **Smart Memory Management**: Efficient memory utilization and caching
- 🔄 **Dynamic Batching**: Intelligent batch size optimization
- 📊 **Quantization Support**: INT8/FP16 precision options for faster inference
- 🛠️ **Easy Integration**: Simple API for existing Flux models
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for custom optimizations
- 📈 **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in profiling and metrics

## Installation

```bash
pip install fluxion
```

## Quick Start

```python
from fluxion import FluxionPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = FluxionPipeline.from_pretrained("model_name")

# Run inference
output = pipeline.generate(
    prompt="your prompt here",
    num_inference_steps=20,
    guidance_scale=7.5
)
```

## Performance Comparison
